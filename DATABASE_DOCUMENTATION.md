- `old_values` - JSON of values before change
- `new_values` - JSON of values after change
- `ip_address` - IP address of the user
- `user_agent` - Browser/client information
- `created_at` - When the action occurred

#### Why This Table is Important:
‚Ä¢ **Security Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for audit trails
‚Ä¢ **Forensic Analysis**: Enables investigation of suspicious activities

‚Ä¢ **Performance Analysis**: Tracks system usage patterns

#### Business Rules:
- All user actions must be logged
- Failed login attempts are also logged

## üîó Table Relationships

### Primary Relationships:
1. **users ‚Üí violations**: One-to-Many
   - One enforcer can issue many violations
   - Cascade delete: If enforcer is deleted, their violations are also deleted

2. **violations ‚Üí sms_logs**: One-to-Many
   - One violation can have multiple SMS notifications
   - Cascade delete: If violation is deleted, SMS logs are also deleted

3. **users ‚Üí audit_logs**: One-to-Many
   - One user can have many audit log entries
   - Set null: If user is deleted, audit logs remain but user_id becomes null

### Design Benefits:
‚Ä¢ **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
‚Ä¢ **Cascade Operations**: Automatic cleanup when parent records are deleted
‚Ä¢ **Query Efficiency**: Proper indexing for fast joins
‚Ä¢ **Scalability**: Structure supports high-volume data growth

---

## üìà Database Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy:
- Primary keys on all tables (auto-indexed)
- Unique indexes on email, username, violation_number, badge_number
- Foreign key indexes for join performance
- Composite indexes on frequently queried fields

### Data Types:
- **DECIMAL** for monetary values (precision maintained)
- **JSON** for flexible data storage (evidence photos, API responses)
- **ENUM** for controlled value sets (status fields)
- **TIMESTAMP** for automatic date/time management

### Security Features:
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **payment_logs** table for detailed payment tracking
- **violation_types** lookup table for standardized violation categories
- **locations** table for predefined violation locations
- **notifications** table for multi-channel communication
- **reports** table for cached report data
- **user_sessions** table for session management

### Scalability Considerations:
- Partitioning for large violation tables
- Read replicas for reporting queries
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Archive strategy for old audit logs

---

## üìù Usage Examples

### Common Queries:

```sql
-- Get all violations by an enforcer
SELECT v.*, u.full_name as enforcer_name 
FROM violations v 
JOIN users u ON v.enforcer_id = u.id 
WHERE u.id = ?;

-- Get violation statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_violations,
  SUM(fine_amount) as total_fines,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'paid' THEN 1 END) as paid_count
FROM violations;

-- Get recent audit activity
SELECT al.*, u.full_name as user_name
FROM audit_logs al
LEFT JOIN users u ON al.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This database design provides a solid foundation for the E-Traffic System, ensuring data integrity, security, and scalability while meeting all business requirements.
